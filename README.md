# Handling Azure vMware Solution (AVS) network connectivity and migration scenario from on-premises to Azure

## [Scenario](#scenario)

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Scenario

In this Microhack, you will :

- be given an overview of the AVS architecture,
- configure HCX and use it to migrate workloads.

This lab is built of :

- 3 vMware vSphere Clusters hosted on-premises along with 3 vCenters,
- 3 AVS solution hosted in Azure regions aligned with the 3 vCenters instances,
- A jumpbox per user deployed in Azure to control a sepcific AVS instance.

Each pair of AVS + on-premises cluster is assigned a unique IP range for the jumpbox. [IP ranges info](docs/Appendix.md)

## Prerequisites

As part of the preparation tasks and to save time during the Microhack day, you are asked to perform the following prior to the Microhack delivery.

### Deploy the prerequisites in your Azure Subscription

We use [BICEP artifacts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) to deploy part of the solution.

Those artifacts contain bicep files to deploy :

- An Azure Virtual Network named "adminVnet";
- A VPN Gateway inside the "GatewaySubnet" of this vnet,
- A Windows 2019 Virtual Machine used as a jumpbox inside the "JumpboxSubnet"
- A bastion service to connect to the jumpbox

This deployment will be connected to the proctor adminVnet containing the Express Route gateway that will give you access to both on-premises vMware environements and AVS.

To make the most of your time on this MircoHack, the green elements in the diagram above are deployed and configured for you through BICEP.

### Task 1 : deploy

Steps:

- Log in to Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/) and select Bash

- Check if the current subscription is the one you want to deploy resources to :

  `az account show`

- If necessary select your target subscription:
  
  `az account set --subscription <Name or ID of subscription>`
  
- Clone the  GitHub repository:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/alexandreweiss/azure-avs-microhack`
  
  - Change directory:
  
  `cd ./azure-avs-microhack/users`

- Now start the deployment (when prompted, confirm with **yes** to start the deployment):

  `az deployment sub create -n rg-deploy-user -l canadacentral --template-file 0-main.bicep`

- You will be asked to enter the ID of the user you registered to in the excel file so you'll get assigned a unique IP range for your deployment.

Deployment takes approximately 30 minutes.

### Task 2 : Explore and verify

After the BICEP deployment concludes successfully, the following has been deployed into your subscription:

- A resource group named **azure-avs-microhack-user-XX-rg** containing :
  - A VNET with a Gateway subnet, a Jumpbox subnet and an Azure Bastion subnet.
  - In each of those subnets :
    - A VPN gateway connected to proctor gateway,
    - A Windows Server Jumbox,
    - A bastion host.

- **The VM will have an auto-shutdown scheduled at night to save cost in your subscription. REMEMBER TO POWER IT ON THE D DAY !**

Verify these resources are present in the portal.

Credentials are identical for all VMs, as follows:

- Username: admin-avs
- Password: MicroHack/123

You may log on to the jumpbox VM through Bastion to test access is successfull.

You may check on the VPN gateway / connection tab, that the connection toHub is in status "connected".

### Task3 : Review material

Please watch the [Azure vMware Solution overview](https://www.site.placeholder) before the Microhack delivery day.

## Proctor deployment


### Task 1: deploy

This must be deployed **only once** per MicroHack and can survive for following MicroHacks. It must be deployed in a **proctor subscription** :

Steps:

- Log in to Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/) and select Bash

- Check if the current subscription is the one you want to deploy resources to :

  `az account show`

- If necessary select your target subscription:
  
  `az account set --subscription <Name or ID of subscription>`
  
- Clone the  GitHub repository:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/alexandreweiss/azure-avs-microhack`
  
  - Change directory:
  
  `cd ./azure-avs-microhack/proctor`

- Now start the deployment (when prompted, confirm with **yes** to start the deployment):

  `az deployment sub create -n rg-deploy-proctor -l canadacentral --template-file 0-main.bicep`

### Task 2 : Explore and verify

After the BICEP deployment concludes successfully, the following has been deployed into your subscription:

- A resource group named **azure-avs-microhack-proctor-1-rg** containing :
  - A VNET with a Gateway subnet, a Jumpbox subnet and an Azure Bastion subnet.
  - In each of those subnets :
    - A VPN gateway connected to users VPN gateways,
    - An ER gateway,
    - An Azure Route Server to route branch to branch traffic,
    - A Windows Server Jumbox,
    - A bastion host.

- **The VM will have an auto-shutdown scheduled at night to save cost in your subscription. REMEMBER TO POWER IT ON THE D DAY !**

Verify these resources are present in the portal.

Credentials are identical for all VMs, as follows:

- Username: admin-avs
- Password: MicroHack/123

You may log on to the jumpbox VM through Bastion to test access is successfull.

You may check BGP is up between Azure Route Server and VPN Gateway by checking the 'BGP Peers' tab on the VPN gateway screen.

Route Server is in Public Preview and is accessible only via https://aka.ms/routeserver
