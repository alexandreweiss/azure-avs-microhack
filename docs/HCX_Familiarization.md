## Configure Site Pairing

Now you're ready to add a site pairing, create a network and compute profile, and enable services such as migration and network extension.

## Add a site pairing
You can connect or pair the VMware HCX Cloud Manager in AVS with the VMware HCX Connector in your On-Prem datacenter.

1.	Sign in to your on-premises vCenter, and under Home, select HCX.

2.	Under Infrastructure, select Site Pairing, and then select the Connect To Remote Site option (in the middle of the screen).

 ![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image15.png)

3.	Enter the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud Manager URL or IP address, username and password to intiate the site pairing. Use the "Credentials&IP" doc for the same

 ![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image16.png)

 ### Note

To successfully establish a site pair:
Your VMware HCX Connector must be able to route to your HCX Cloud Manager IP over port 443.

You'll see a screen showing that your VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution and your on-premises VMware HCX Connector are connected (paired).

## Create Network Profiles

VMware HCX Connector deploys a subset of virtual appliances (automated) that require multiple IP segments. When you create your network profiles, you use the IP segments that have been identified during the VMware HCX Network Segments pre-deployment preparation and planning stage.

### Note

Generally in a customer scenario we create multiple network profiles for the networks below

#### Management	
#### vMotion
#### Replication
#### Uplink


For this MicroHack, we will be using the same network profile for all the four networks

1.	Under Infrastructure, select Interconnect > Multi-Site Service Mesh > Network Profiles > Create Network Profile.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image18.png)

2.	For each network profile, select the network and port group, provide a name, and create the segment's IP pool. Then select Create. Please refer to the Credentials&IP document for the details for the IP addresses to be used
 
![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image19.png)

3.	Once done, the network profile created by you will be available to be used by the Interconnect and Network Extension appliances within the Service Mesh

## Create a service mesh

Now it's time to configure a service mesh between on-premises and Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

### Note
To successfully establish a service mesh with Azure VMware Solution:
Ports UDP 500/4500 are open between your on-premises VMware HCX Connector 'uplink' network profile addresses and the Azure VMware Solution HCX Cloud 'uplink' network profile addresses.
Be sure to review the VMware HCX required ports.

1.	Under Infrastructure, select Interconnect > Service Mesh > Create Service Mesh.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image34.png)

2.	Review the sites that are pre-populated, and then select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image35.png)

### Note
If this is your first service mesh configuration, you won't need to modify this screen

3.	Select the source and remote compute profiles from the drop-down lists, and then select Continue.

The selections define the resources where VMs can consume VMware HCX services.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image36.png)

4.	Review services that will be enabled, and then select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image37.png)

5.	In Advanced Configuration - Override Uplink Network profiles, select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image38.png)

### Note
Uplink network profiles connect to the network through which the remote site's interconnect appliances can be reached

6.	In Advanced Configuration - Network Extension Appliance Scale Out, review and select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image39.png)

### Note 
You can have up to eight VLANs per appliance, but you can deploy another appliance to add another eight VLANs. You must also have IP space to account for the more appliances, and it's one IP per appliance. For more information, see VMware HCX Configuration Limits.

7. In Advanced Configuration - Traffic Engineering, do not select the Application Path Resiliency and Traffic Flow Conditioning, and then select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image40.png)

8.	Review the topology preview and select Continue.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image41.png)

9.	Enter the name for this HCX-Microhack-ServiceMesh and select Finish to complete.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image42.png)

9.	Select View Tasks to monitor the deployment.
 
When the service mesh deployment finishes successfully, you'll see the services as green.

10.	Verify the service mesh's health by checking the appliance status.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image43.png)

11.	Select Interconnect > Appliances.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image44.png)

## Extend Network
In this step you will extend any the on-premises environment to Azure VMware Solution.

1.	Under Services, select Network Extension > Create a Network Extension.

2.	Select each of the networks you want to extend to Azure VMware Solution, and then select Next

3.	Enter the on-premises gateway IP for each of the networks you're extending, and then select Submit.

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image45.png)

The IP address to be used and extended is defined in the IP address / Login document

It takes a few minutes for the network extension to finish. When it does, you see the status change to Extension complete.

## Next steps
If the HCX interconnect tunnel status is UP and green, you can migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs by using VMware HCX. Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations (with or without a network extension). You can still migrate workloads in your vSphere environment, along with on-premises creation of networks and deployment of VMs onto those networks.


## Migrate a VM

1.	To migrate a virtual machine from and On Prem Environment to AVS, sign in to your on-premises vCenter, and under Home, select HCX.

2.	Under Services, select Migration, and then select the Migrate

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image46.png)

3.	One the Workload Mobility window is opened, ensure your site pairing is available from On Prem to AVS. 

4.	Select mhack-tinycore1 as a VM that will be migrated from On-Prem to AVS and press Add 

![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image47.png)

5.	Once the virtual machine is added, select the transfer and placement parameters for the virtual machine post migration to AVS and then press validate
 
![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image48.png)

6.	Once the transfer and placement validation of the virtual machine has gone through, press go for the migration of the virtual machine


![](/Images/HCX/HCX_image49.png)
 
7.	Once the VM is migrated into AVS, check the IP address of the VM. 

Note : 

As the VM that was migrated was on a extended network, the IP address of the VM has not changed; however if the VM that was migrated was not on an extended network, then the IP address of the VM would have changed. 


This concludes the HCX familiarisation for AVS!!
