Challenge 2.3
"2.3 Lets explore NSX - So we need to add a DNS Forwarder"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Configure a DNS forwarder

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to log on to the AVS Private cloud assigned to your team and to either create a DNS forwarder if it doesnt already exist. If the default DNS forwarder exists then you can try and resolve your AVS VM name records through thr public DNS listed within the default DNS forwarder

## Use Case Tip 

By default, Azure VMware Solution management components such as vCenter can only resolve name records available through Public DNS. However, certain hybrid use cases require Azure VMware Solution management components to resolve name records from privately hosted DNS to properly function, including customer-managed systems such as vCenter and Active Directory.

Private DNS for Azure VMware Solution management components lets you define conditional forwarding rules for the desired domain name to a selected set of private DNS servers through the NSX-T DNS Service.

This capability uses the DNS Forwarder Service in NSX-T. A DNS service and default DNS zone are provided as part of your private cloud. To enable Azure VMware Solution management components to resolve records from your private DNS systems, you must define an FQDN zone and apply it to the NSX-T DNS Service. The DNS Service conditionally forwards DNS queries for each zone based on the external DNS servers defined in that zone.

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. 

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server and the NSX Manager.

## Configure a DNS forwarder

1.  In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under Workload Networking, select DNS > DNS zones. Then select Add.

2.  Select default zone
 
3.  Provide a name and up to three DNS server IP addresses in the format of 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Then select Save.

It takes several minutes to complete, and you can follow the progress from Notifications. Youâ€™ll see a message in the Notifications when the DNS zone has been created.

4.  Select the DNS services tab and then select Add DNS Service and provide the details of the name, select Tier 1 Gateway, DNS Server IP and Default DNS Done and press Save.

It takes several minutes to complete and once finished, you'll see the Completed message from Notifications. At this point, management components in your private cloud should be able to resolve DNS entries from the FQDN zone provided to the NSX-T DNS Service.


Take the dhcp client VM used in the previus document and resolve a public FQDN from within the VM

This concludes the NSX DNS Forwarder for AVS!!
