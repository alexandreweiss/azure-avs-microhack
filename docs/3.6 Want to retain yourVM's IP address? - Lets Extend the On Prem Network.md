Challenge 3.6
"Want to retain yourVM's IP address? - Lets Extend the On Prem Network"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

6.	Extend Network 

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. Incorrectly deploying the HCX may result in multiple forthcoming steps not operating as expected.

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server.

## Extend Network
In this step you will extend any the on-premises environment to Azure VMware Solution.

1.	Under Services, select Network Extension > Create a Network Extension.

2.	Select each of the networks you want to extend to Azure VMware Solution, and then select Next

3.	Enter the on-premises gateway IP for each of the networks you're extending, and then select Submit.

The IP address to be used and extended is defined in the IP address / Login document

It takes a few minutes for the network extension to finish. When it does, you see the status change to Extension complete.

## Next steps
If the HCX interconnect tunnel status is UP and green, you can migrate and protect Azure VMware Solution VMs by using VMware HCX. Azure VMware Solution supports workload migrations (with or without a network extension). You can still migrate workloads in your vSphere environment, along with on-premises creation of networks and deployment of VMs onto those networks.

This concludes the HCX network extension for AVS!!
